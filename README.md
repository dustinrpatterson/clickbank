## Coding Challenge!

Coding Sample 

A client wants to query the company API and show the email, item #, item title, quantity and price for each receipt entered in a given time period. 

In this simplified example, the vendor is boisandbox and there is no date range that needs to be passed in to the query string to get the list of receipts. Instead I built a very straightforward endpoint that will return a small set of data in the AWS cloud. 

The endpoint for the API is www.jakelake.io/api/ and it takes either a vendor query string parameter or a receipt query string parameter. 

Please write a webpage with a simple UI that accepts a vendor nickname string, and returns the receipts associated with that nickname. Please also provide an input field with a button that will recursively query all the receipts associated with that nickname and show the email, item #, item title, quantity and price of the item based on the JSON objects that return from the above api. 

If you have any clarification questions, please email Deanna. We are happy to jump in and explain anything that is unclear or that needs additional information. 

Email your solution in a zip file to Deanna whenever you're satisfied with it. 

Cheers,
Jake
